Humans also have a very diverse army, ranging from heavy calvary and flying units to casters, and even siege units. Furthermore, Humans also have three different tower types, a unique quality shared with Undead. Humans have a very high skill ceiling which takes years of mastery.",

        description: "Orcs are best defined as an aggressive bloodthirsty race. Early harass is a hallmark trait of a good Orc player. Orc has some of the best heores in the game, all with a diverse set of skills that prove useful at any stage of the game. Orcs also have strong starting melee units in the form of Grunts. Orc also posses a high skill ceiling with some of the best players able to use gurilla like tactics against armies of larger size"

        description: 'Undead is the most user friendly race in my opinion. To begin, buildings build themselves and the mine has a specific ammount of slots as to let the player know when maximum capacity has been reached. Also, Undeads lumber gatherer is also its tier one melee unit, useful to defend against an early harass. Furthermore, Undeads food producing structure can also be used as a tower, also good for defensive purposes. As far as army composition, undead has very strong units and has the best heroes to "nuke" Other players with.'

        description: "Night Elf is another user friendly race. Employing the most common strategies are pretty simple and straight forward. Night Elves also have strong heroes that can compliment army composition and be used to hunt down other heroes. Night Elf has some more advanced strategies, but these are not often seen in game either because they are situational or other more common stratiegies are just easier, overall a fun race."
