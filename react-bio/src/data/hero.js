        info: "The Paladin is classified as a defender of the light. Primarily a support hero, the Paladin is best utilized to heal and support other units. The Paladin is a melee unit with the spells Holy Light, Devotion Aura, Divine Shield, and Ressurection. Holy light is a single target heal that can not be casted upon yourself. Devotion Aura is an area of effect buff that increases the armor of allied forces within a certain range. Divine Shield temporarily provides the Paladin with immortality, blocking all incoming damage and spells. Ressurection is the Paladins ultimate ability, at level 6 you are able to bring back to life up to 6 ground based allied units nearby permanently. A few tips for picking a Paladin, never pick a Paladin first unless you are playing against an Undead player and even then there are still better options. Furthermore, do not skill Divine Shield and Devotion Aura together, pick one to scale with Holy Light as it is the Paladins most useful ability.",

The Archmages abilites are Blizzard, Summon Water Elemental, Brilliance Aura, and Mass Teleportation. Blizzard is an area of effect spell that hurls icy bolts from the sky in waves dealing damage and slowing enemies. Summon Water Elemental raises a watery minion to fight along side the Archmage for a duration of time. Brilliance Aura is another area of effect spell that offers bonus mana regeneration to all nearby allied forces. Mass Teleportation is the Archmages ultimate ability, allowing the Archmage to teleport up to 24 of the players nearby units to a friendly ground unit or structure. Archmage is one of the only heroes who can be used to take a fast expansion by using the footmen's Milita ability. Furthermore, when playing Archmage it is best to either level Summon Water Elemental or Blizzard with Brilliance Aura as the mana regeneration will allow you to keep casting.",

Thunder Clap is a small area of effect spell that does a decent ammount of damage and slows nearby enemy units in range of the Mountain King. Bash is a passive ability that grants each auto attack a chance to stun a target for a sort duration on impact. Avatar, his ultimate, renders the Mountain Giant spell immune with bonus armor, health, and damage. The Mountain King can be a great first or second pick, usually paired with a Blood Mage or Archmage in order to keep his mana up. Storm Bolt is a very powerful spell, useful for stunning an enemy hero in order to surround and kill them.",

Blood Mages abilities are Flame Strike, Siphon Mana, Banish, and Phoenix is his ultimate ability. Flame Stike hurls a firey meteor down to the ground causing massive damage on impact and burning damage over time to those who stand in the flames. Siphon mana can be used to either steal mana from enemy players, giving it to the Blood Mage, or it can be used for the Bloodmage to give an allied hero mana at the cost of his own. Banish is a single target ability that when casted, renders an enemy unit etheral, which cannot take physical attacks, but takes increased magic damage. Phoenix, Blood Mages ultimate ability, summons a firey bird that can attack multiple units at once with splash damage. Blood Mage is a great support hero for Mountain King as he can keep his mana bar full and offer an increased ammount of damage to Storm Bolt by applying Banish to the enemy unit first. Also Phoenix has no duration, it slowly loses health until it turns into an egg and hatches again into a new phoenix. A good Blood Mage player will make sure to move his Phoenix out of harms way before it turns into an egg in order to keep it alive as long as possible.",

Critical Strike is a passive ability that has the chance to multiply your damage by a certain ammount. Mirror Image creates multiple replications of the Blademaster that appear identical to the enemy, but cause no damage. Blademasters Ultimate ability, Bladestorm, does a large ammount of damage to nearby units or structures hit by the Blademasters whirling blade. When playing the Blademaster never level mirror image first, in fact you should never level it period, its usefullness is heavily outweighed by his other skills.

Chain Lightning is a targeted burst damage spell that bounces to multiple targets, diminishing in damage with each bounce. Feral Spirit is often seen as Far Seers first ability as it allows him to summon two spirit wolves to fight along side him. Far Seers ultimate ability Earthquake slows units dramatically within a certain radius while also causing a large ammount of damage to buildings. Far Seer is often seen as a first pick due to his ability to harass with Feral Spirit and Chain Lightning.

Tuaren Chieftains core abilities to skill together are War Stomp and Endurance Aura as they will allow you to move in quickly and stun enemy units as your army picks them off. War Stomp is a really powerful spell at level three, offering a five second stun on a 6 second cooldown, that is insane!",

Hex is an ability that turns any enemy unit, including heroes, into a frog for a short duration of time. Serpent Ward can be used to summon a stationary ranged attack ward, more than one can be summoned over their duration. Big Bad Voodoo is a very powerful area of effect spell that provides attack and spell immunity to all nearby allied units. The Shadow Hunter is often seen as a second pick since his abilities, especially healing, are all useful throughout the game.

Death Knight has one of the fastest if not the fastest movement speeds in the game, making him hard to catch and escape. Death Knights skills are Death Coil, Death Pact, Unholy Aura, and his ultimate is Animate Dead. Death Coil is probably Death Knights best ability, being a single target spell that can be used to either heal an allied undead unit, or used to damage any living enemy unit. Death Pact is an okay ability that allows the death knight to sacrifice a unit in exchange for healing. Unholy Aura is also a very good skill, applying a movement speed and health regeneration buff to all nearby party members. Animate Dead, his ultimate, raises 6 dead ground based units near the Death Knight to fight for a short duration. The Death Knight is best picked first as his Death Coil allows for you to heal units while creeping and in battle. Death Knight and Lich are considered to be one of the strongest hero combinations for nuking down enemy heroes with their Coil-Nova combo. Furthermore Death Knights ultimate can also raise enemy units, and they are immortal for the period of their duration.",

Lichs abilities are Frost Nova, Frost Armor, Dark Ritual, and his ultimate ability is Death and Decay. Frost Nova is an area of effect spell that does a high ammount of damage to the targeted unit while doing a smaller ammount of damage to nearby units. Dark Ritual allows the Lich to sacrifice one of his own units in order to gain back mana. Frost Armor is an auto cast ability you can use to buff party members with increased armor which applies a speed debuff to enemies when they strike. Death and Decay is Lichs ultimate ability, allowing him to cause damage everything in an area of effect over time. Lich is best used as a second hero choice after Death Knight as Frost Nova can be used in conjunction with Death Coil to kill enemy heroes. Although Death and Decay does damage to all things caught in its radius, it is best used on structures. Furthermore, do not under estimate the usefulness of Frost Armor, it may seem like a weak spell but the movement speed debuff applied to enemies stops them from keeping up with a fleeing hero.",

Sleep is a single target spell that puts the enemy unit to sleep for a short duration of time unless attacked. Vampiric Aura is an area of effect party buff that grants all nearby allied units with melee attack life regeneration. Inferno, the Dread Lords ultimate ability is considered the best summoned unit in the game, although I would argue doom guard is slightly better given his spells. The Dread Lord is not often seen used anymore, but a high level Dread Lord being played by a skilled player can turn around a battle just by summoning Inferno. The Dread Lord is a very powerful hero, and if you choose to have more heroes support him, Death Knight will be your best option, but try to delay the build of the second hero to give the Dread Lord the boost in experience he needs to stay ahead.",

Carrion Beetles allows the Crypt Lord to summon beetles from corpses, up to 5 can be summoned at a time. Spiked Carapace adorns the Crypt Lords exoskeleton with spikes, granting him bonus armor and the ability to return damage taken to enemies. His ultimate ability Locust Swarm creates a swarm of locusts that damage all units around the Crypt Lord for a period of time until returning to the Crypt Lord to give him back health based off the damage. The Crypt Lord is often seen as a third hero choice since his Impale may be more useful than Dreadlords Carrion Swarm. The Crypt Lord can be used as a first hero choice by a skilled player due to his abilites to summon beetles and creep fast, althought Death Knight is generally regarded as a better pick because of Death Coil and Unholy Aura.",

His abilities are Entangling Roots, Force of Nature, Thorns Aura, and his ultimate is Tranquility. Entangling Roots is a single target ranged spell that entraps any unit in roots causing small damage over its duration. Force of Nature is a summon ability that requires trees to use, good for early harass or fast creeping. Thorns Aura provides all party members with a buff that returns a percentage of damage taken back to the enemy. Tranquility, Keeper of the Groves ultimate ability, heals all party members in a large area around the Keeper of the Grove. When playing Keeper of the Grove it is always best to level Entangling roots one time by level 2 as it is very useful for trapping enemy heroes and finishing off fleeing units. Furthermore, due to his ability to summon, Keeper of the Grove is often seen as a first pick. His summons also make an Ancient of War expansion strategy easier, which can be found in the stratigies page. One last thing about Keeper of the Grove is that his ultimate ability pairs well with both Priestess of the Moons ultimate, and Wardens ultimate.",

Searing Arrow is an auto cast ability that buffs the Priestess of the Moons auto attack with a high ammount of bonus damage. Trueshot Aura is a great support ability for ranged units as it grants bonus damage to all ranged units within a certain radius of Priestess of the Moon. Her ultimate ability, Starfall is an ability that calls down bolts of light from the sky in waves causing high damage to units with each wave in a large area surrounding the Priestess of the Moon. Priestess of the Moon is often seen as a second or on occasion as a third pick for night elf players. Her Trueshot Aura pairs well with all units in the night elf army besides mountain giants and druids of the claw. Searing Arrow is also a good ability that pairs well with Trueshot Aura, and with the right items, Priestess of the Moon can snipe down enemy heroes with her auto attack. One last thing to remember is that her starfall ability pairs really well with Keeper of the Groves ultimate ability, and casting both, let alone one can really shift the tide of battle back in your favor.",

Immolation coats the Demon Hunter in flames, causing damage to all units near him as long as it is active. Evasion gives the Demon Hunter a chance to dodge attacks, pretty simple. Metamorphosis, the Demon Hunters ultimate grants him bonus health, damage, and the ability to attack from a range with chaos damage. When playing the Demon Hunter it is best to level up Mana Burn as it is good to use for disabling enemy heroes from casting spells. Immolation is often seen as a sub-par skill but it definitely has its uses, especially for harassing worker units like peasants or peons. Furthermore, Demon Hunters Metamorphosis is overpowered and in general there is no solid counter to it besides to run from him.

Fan of Knives is an area of effect spell that does damage to all units in a specific range around the Warden. Blink is a spell that allows the Warden to teleport short distance, great for engaging or escaping. Shadow Strike is a ranged single target damage spell that slows the enemy while also doing damage over a short duration. Vengance is Wardens ultimate ability, summoning a spirit of vengance which also raises other spirits from the dead which do damage and are immortal for their duration. Warden is a very powerful hero once past level 5 and will often be seen without another hero pick or with a delayed second hero so the Warden can gain a level advantage early. Her Vengance ability is best used when there are many corpses on the ground as that is where spirits are raised from. Also the main vengance spirit that is summoned that summons the rest is not immortal so do what you can to protect it. Finally as a last tip, although you could level Fan of Knives with Shadow strike, it is better to pick one to level with blink as using both will quickly drain mana and leave you with no ability to engage or escape with.",

Forked Lightning is a ranged spell that shoots mutliple bolts of lightning at enemies within a certain range hitting a maximum of three units. Frost Arrow is a great autocast spell that adds damage to her auto attack while slowing the targets movement speed. Mana Shield is another good spell that offers Naga Sea Witch some damage resistance at the cost of mana based on damage intake. Tornado is her ultimate ability, summoning a giant tornado that slows enemy units within range, has a chance to toss enemy units and heroes in the air for a period of time, and causes heavy damage to structures. Naga Sea Witch is a great second or third pick because her Frost Arrows stop enemy units from escaping. Her Forked lightning also offers a good ammount of burst damage at a range to finish units or heroes off who are trying to flee.

Storm, Earth, and Fire is Panderan Brewmasters ultimate ability splitting him into three different units that all come with their own unique set of spells and good stats for a short duration before morphing back into a single hero. When playing Pandaren Brewmaster, it is best to pair Breath of Fire with Drunken Haze as Breath of Fire does bonus damage to units affected by Drunken Haze. Also, when Pandaren Brewmaster uses his ultimate ability and splits into three, if all three die, so does Pandaren Brewmaster. Only one of the three summons must survive for the Pandaren Brewmaster to return at the end of his Ultimate ability.",

        info:"Pit Lord is a gigantic melee tavern hero that imbues thoughts of terror in the enemies mind. Although intimidating in looks, he is often considered a weak hero choice but can still be a viable option for the skilled player. Pit Lords abilities are Rain of Fire, Howl of Terror, Cleaving Attack, and his ultimate ability is Doom. Rain of Fire calls down waves of meteorites from the sky causing damage with each wave and burning damage over time to units hit. Howl of Terror is an area of effect debuff spell that reduces all enemy attack damage within a certain range. Cleaving Attack is a passive ability which causes Pit Lords auto attack to cause a percentage of damage to nearby units based off the level of the spell and Pit Lords attack damage. Doom is Pit Lords ultimate ability which is a single target damage over time spell with the that lasts until the unit dies and summons a Doom Guard upon death. Although Pit Lord is considered a weak hero pick, he has quite useful abilities, with his ultimate summoning one of the best summonable units in the game. The one good thing about Pit Lord is that you have more flexibility when leveling his skills, they all pair well with eachother because they all do pretty different things, all being useful to the player. One last tip about Pit Lord, although most games do not usually see a level 6 hero, Pit Lords ultimate ability is quite powerful and comes with its own set of spells. A good player who can utilize the Doom Guards spells can make a huge difference in battle.",

        info:"Goblin Tinker is an interesting tavern hero with quite different abilities than his contemporaries. A ranged hero, he utilizes technology to gain the edge in battle. Goblin Tinkers abilities are Pocket Factory, Cluster Rockets, Engineering, and Robo-Goblin is his Ultimate. Pocket Factory is probably Goblin Tinkers most picked first ability as it creates a factory that produces summons which attack and explode on death, more than one Pocket Factory can be up at a time. Cluster Rockets is a very underestimated ability as it is a ranged area of effect damage spell that also acts as a stun, very useful indeed. Engineering Upgrade is another underrated ability that makes all of Goblin Tinkers spells better, but should really be paired with either Cluster Rockets or Pocket Factoring when leveling. Goblin Tinkers ultimate ability is Robo-Goblin which transforms the hero into a giant robot that has bonus health, armor, immunity to most spells, and does siege damage to buildings. Goblin Tinker is a very interesting hero because he builds like a support with an ultimate like a Tank. Again, when leveling Engineering, if at all, level it with ONLY ONE of Goblin Tinkers other abilities to maxamize the potential of both skills. Although Goblin Tinker seems like a solid pick all around, he does suffer slightly from being outpicked by more viable options and also requires a level of skill to play right.",

        info:"Firelord is a ranged hero made completely of flames surrounded by armor. The Firelord is probably the least picked hero out of any hero in the game, not because he is bad himself, but other options just pair better when considering possible hero combinations. The Firelords abilities are Soul Burn, Summon Lava Spawn, Incinetate, and his ultimate ability is Volcano. Soul Burn is a damage over time spell that also silences the enemy and reduces attack speed by 50%, great to cast on heroes. Summon Lava Spawn summons a ranged unit that will split after it consumes the flesh of its target. Incinerate is an autocast spell that buffs the Firelords attack with damage, doubling with each stack. The Firelords ultimate ability is Volcano which causes a wave of molten rock to damage nearby ground units and buildings every 5 seconds, also stunning targets hit by each wave. The Firelord is not a commonly choosen hero and I would never recommend picking it first for this exact reason unless you really know what you are doing. Although the Firelords skills may seem attractive, other picks are just more viable, like Dark Ranger who arguably, has a better form of silence and summons.",

        info:"Beastmaster is a melee ranged neutral hero that has mastery over the different beasts of the land. Beastmaster is a harder hero to play as he requires good micromanagement skills with his summons to be effective. His skills are Summon Bear, Summon Quilbeast, Summon Hawk, and Stampede is Beastmasters ultimate ability. Summon Bear is usually the most attractive skill to level first as the bear has a hefty ammount of health and can learn blink down the line. Quilbeast is really powerful once you level the skill, you can summon up to four quilbeasts at once that do splash damage. Summon Hawk is Beastmasters most underrated skill as at level one it is quite weak, but later on it can be used to scout and deliver killing blows on units and even heroes without boots equipped or a movement speed bonus. Stampede is one of the best Ultimates in the game, summoning a tuarent of thunder-lizards to run across the screen, exploding on contact and dealing heavy damage. Beastmaster is a challenging hero to use, but with the right micromanagement of his summons he can be a real problem for enemy players. Beastmaster is also heavily dependent on mana, so keeping an extra mana pot or clarity pot always comes in handy.",

        info:"Goblin Alchemist is one of the most common choices amongst Tavern heroes to be selected. He is a melee ranged hero that can be played as a support or as a dps.Goblin Alchemists skills are Healing Spray, Chemical Rage, Acid Bomb, with his ultimate ability being Transmute. Healing Spray is recognized as his best ability, healing friendly units in an area of effect for a short duration. Chemical Rage is another great ability to scale with Healing Spray as it is also an area of effect spell that reduces enemy armor inside a certain radius. Chemical Rage is good for engaging or escaping due to its movement speed bonus, but the overall damage increase and movement speed is not as useful when compared to the other two abilities. Transmute is Goblin Alchemists ultimate ability, instantly killing a hostile non-hero unit giving the player gold based on unit value. Goblin is best utilized as a support hero, casting healing spray in conjunction with Acid Bomb or Chemical rage. Goblin is often seen as a secondary hero choice for night elf players and also pairs well with orc in certain situations. Overall Goblin Alchemist is a well rounded hero that can be utilized to keep your army alive while also increasing the damage intake of enemy forces given a good player controls the hero.",
